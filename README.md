# RedixoLabs | Smart Agro Project

-------------------
## About Project
Smart Agro Project is an IoT and AI project consists of several sensors that sends alerts over the text messages/email/calls to farmers .

## DEMO
### IoT Kit Demo

 > Our model have several sensors that takes readings from farmers field through microcontroller . We've set thresold minimum and maximum values for each sensors when sensor values will be out of thresold values, then we'll send alerts.
In demo, we've used temperature & intensity sensors, here temperature value are not in thresold value, so simply we are turning on electric motor(LED for demo) and sending alerts over text message .
